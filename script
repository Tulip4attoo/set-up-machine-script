Set Up Deep Learning Env on Ubuntu 22.04

Following this very good instruction (modified a bit - just changed the version): https://www.cloudbooklet.com/how-to-set-up-deep-learning-architecture-on-ubuntu-22-04/#install-nvidia-drivers

# for 2 graphic cards laptop, you should switch to NVIDIA card first 
# https://www.linuxbabe.com/desktop-linux/switch-intel-nvidia-graphics-card-ubuntu

#update system 

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Install NVIDIA Drivers

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-525

# Install CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN
# I use cuda_11.5.r11.5/compiler.30672275_0 (checking by nvcc --version)
# maybe you should go to nvidia site and check for the suitable version
# not so sure if cuda 12 has some advantage? I think maybe in bp16? 
# will revisit this later

# you could follow this instruction from nvidia
# https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
# and will not need 2 following lines

wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.2.0/local_installers/cuda_11.2.0_460.27.04_linux.run
sudo sh cuda_11.2.0_460.27.04_linux.run

# Now, Update the environment variables, and add the following lines to ~/.bashrc
# you could change cuda-xx.y to your cuda version, for example cuda-12.1

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.2/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.2/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# Activate the environment variables:

source ~/.bashrc

# Install CUDNN
# re check by nvcc -V
# come here to download https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive
# please choose the cudnn with the same version of cuda

tar -zvxf cudnn-11.2-linux-x64-v8.1.0.77.tgz
sudo cp -P cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda-11.2/include
sudo cp -P cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda-11.2/lib64/
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda-11.2/lib64/libcudnn*


# It just done for cuda part. Python part could be handled easily by Conda, so I will not talk about it here. 
# I do think torch is easy to install if you handle cuda right.
